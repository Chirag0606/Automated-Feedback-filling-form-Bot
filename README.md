# Automated-Feedback-filling-form-Bot
An automated feedback filling form bot is a type of software that is built using the Python programming language and can automatically fill out and submit electronic feedback forms. The bot can be programmed using Python libraries and frameworks such as Selenium, BeautifulSoup, or Scrapy to interact with web pages and extract form fields, and can use Python libraries such as Requests or Urllib to submit the filled forms. The bot can be set up to run on a schedule or in response to certain triggers and can be integrated with other systems such as a database or an API. This type of bot can save time and effort for users by automating the process of filling out and submitting feedback forms, and can also help to ensure that feedback is submitted consistently and in a timely manner.

The specific system requirements for an automated feedback filling form bot using Python will depend on the particular libraries and frameworks that are used to build the bot. However, in general, the following are some of the key requirements that would be needed to run such a bot:
. A computer or server running a compatible operating system, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS.
. A recent version of Python (3.x) installed on the system.
. Required python libraries and dependencies installed, such as Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests, etc.
. A web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, that is compatible with the version of Selenium being used.
. Internet connection to interact with web pages.
. If the bot is running on a schedule, a task scheduler such as cron (on Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) should be set up to run the script at a specified  interval.
. It's also worth noting that if the bot is going to be running for a long period of time and submitting a large number of forms, it may be necessary to consider additional system resources such as memory or processing power to handle the workload.
